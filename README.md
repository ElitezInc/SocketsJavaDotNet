# Task Description
Implement a WebSocket functionality and send data in text and binary formats between server and client written with different programming languages.

# Project setup

## Server
Open JavaServer project with Intellij and run it, once it shows "Waiting for the client connection", you can then proceed running the client.

## Client
Open WindowsClient .sln project with visual studio, then you can start the project with debugging or without debugging by pressing ctrl + f5, then observe how client-server functionality is working.

# Todo
* Upgrade the Windows client to WPF application
* Implement server functionality in NodeJS
* Add more features, because at the moment both server and client only contains working core logic for data transfer
* Test functionality with multiple clients (at the moment it's only tested with one client)
* Create more projects with Socket.io library, also Android Studio and Xamarin projects as clients
